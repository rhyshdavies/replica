    <h1>Privacy Policy for Clueless</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 10, 2026</p>

    <p>Clueless ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Photos:</strong> To provide our core virtual try-on feature, the App requires you to
            upload a full-body photo (your "Digital Twin"). This photo is stored securely in Firebase Storage. Garment
            photos you add to your closet are also stored.</li>

        <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> You may sign in using Apple Sign In, which may share your name and
            email address with us (depending on your Apple ID settings). If you choose not to sign in, we use Firebase
            Anonymous Authentication, which does not collect personal identifiers.</li>

        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous data about how you interact with the App (e.g., screen
            views, swipes, item interactions, try-on events) using Firebase Analytics. This data is used to improve our
            recommendation engine and user experience.</li>

        <li><strong>Session Recordings:</strong> We use Smartlook to record anonymized user sessions. This helps us
            identify bugs and improve the user experience. These recordings do not capture sensitive information like
            passwords or personal contact details.</li>

        <li><strong>Pinterest Data:</strong> If you choose to connect your Pinterest account, we access your public
            boards
            and pins to import style inspiration. We do not store your Pinterest credentials; authentication is handled
            by Pinterest's OAuth flow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtual Try-On:</strong> Your photo is sent to third-party AI services to generate virtual try-on
            images showing you wearing fashion items. Garment photos are also processed by AI to create clean product
            images for your digital closet.</li>

        <li><strong>Image Preparation:</strong> Your photo is processed by a server-side image segmentation service to
            crop and prepare it for virtual try-on. Only the photo is sent; no other personal data is transmitted.</li>

        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> We use your style preferences and interaction data to recommend outfits
            and
            products tailored to your taste.</li>

        <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> We use usage data and session recordings to enhance our styling algorithms
            and user interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>

    <p>We share data with the following third-party services solely to provide the App's functionality:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google Cloud):</strong> For authentication, database, file storage, analytics, and remote
            configuration.</li>

        <li><strong>Google Vertex AI (Gemini):</strong> For AI-powered image generation. Your photos and garment images
            are sent to Google's servers to generate virtual try-on results, digitize garments, and analyze clothing
            metadata.</li>

        <li><strong>Image Processing Service:</strong> A server-side segmentation service crops and prepares your photo
            for
            virtual try-on. Only the uploaded photo is sent.</li>

        <li><strong>Smartlook:</strong> For anonymized session recording and user behavior analytics.</li>

        <li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> If you connect your account, we access your public boards and pins via
            Pinterest's
            API. We do not share your data with Pinterest.</li>

        <li><strong>ASOS:</strong> To fetch fashion product catalog data (product images, descriptions, pricing). No
            user
            data is sent to ASOS.</li>

        <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Sign in with Apple provides authentication. Apple may share your name and email
            based
            on your preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not sell your personal data. Data shared with third parties is used only to provide the App's features and
        is subject to each provider's own privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>All personal data (photos, profiles, and closet items) is stored using <strong>Firebase (Google
                Cloud)</strong>,
            which employs industry-standard encryption and security practices.</li>

        <li>Photos and profile data are only accessible by you (the authenticated user).</li>

        <li>AI-processed images are generated on-demand and stored in your private account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Your data is retained for as long as your account exists.</li>

        <li>When you delete your account, all associated data (photos, profile, closet items, saved outfits) is
            permanently deleted from our servers.</li>

        <li>Anonymous analytics data is retained in aggregate form and cannot be linked back to you after account
            deletion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we
        will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You can delete your account and all associated data (including photos, closet items, and saved outfits) at
            any
            time directly within the App's settings.</li>

        <li>You can disconnect your Pinterest account at any time.</li>

        <li>You can request a copy of your data by contacting us at the email below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the
        "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance
        of the updated policy.</p>
