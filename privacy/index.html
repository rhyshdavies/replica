    <h1>Privacy Policy for Clueless</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</p>

    <p>Clueless ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>User-Provided Photos:</strong> To provide our core virtual try-on feature, the App requires you to
            upload a full-body photo (the "Mannequin"). This photo is stored securely in Firebase Storage.</li>

        <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> We use Firebase Anonymous Authentication. This does not collect your
            name, email, or phone number unless you choose to link an account later.</li>

        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous data about how you interact with the App (e.g.,
            swipes, item views) to improve our recommendation engine.</li>

        <li><strong>Session Recordings:</strong> We use Smartlook to record user sessions. This allows us to see how you
            use the App in real-time to identify bugs and improve the user experience. These recordings do not capture
            sensitive information like passwords or personal contact details.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Virtual Try-On:</strong> Your photo is processed by Google Gemini AI to generate photorealistic
            images of you wearing fashion items.</li>

        <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> We use usage data to enhance our styling algorithms and user interface.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>All personal data (photos and profiles) is stored using <strong>Firebase (Google Cloud)</strong>, which
            employs industry-standard security practices.</li>

        <li>Photos are only accessible by you (the authenticated user) and are never shared with third parties for
            marketing purposes.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For authentication, database, and image storage.</li>

        <li><strong>Google Vertex AI (Gemini):</strong> For processing virtual try-on images.</li>

        <li><strong>Smartlook:</strong> For session recording and user behavior analytics.</li>

        <li><strong>ASOS API:</strong> To fetch fashion product data.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>

    <p>You can delete your account and all associated data (including your photos) at any time directly within the App's
        settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
